Practicing CSS by cloning a website - flexbox, positioning
some transforms, translates, media queries, and navbar 
collapse.

7/10/20 - moving on to vanilla js. Add modal functionality with contact form using js from scratch.

Added an events HTML, Css and JS. The JS I wrote creates a calendar on the web page that updates the 
Month year and the dates as you select month with arrow key.

7/16/2020 - I refactored the calendar code which had some redundencies. I also added a submit events 
form to add an events background image to the claendar date you input. I also added local storage methods 
to store and retrieve created events.


TO Dos:

-Make storage methods add an array of events that are displayed on the calendar if the current month is the same as the stored event month.

-Add a delete events functionallity

-make calendar responsive

-clear submit form inputs on submit.

-Add event TItle and subtext.

-refactor code more.

-optional but can add a hover effect to events to make it larger and easier to see?
